How to compile and upload the project's code: 
WINDOWS
1) Have installed make and MSYS/WSL, open the CLI
2) Enter the build enviroment by typing ". /opt/mcb32tools/environment" (without quotation marks)
3) Navigate to the project folder with "cd" ("IS1200-expo/mp-test" is where you should be)
4) Type "make" in the terminal to compile the code
5) Connect the UNO32 to computer via USB
6) Type "make install TTYDEV=/dev/ttySX" in the terminal to upload the code to the Uno32. You will have to identify which port (S1, S2, etc) the Uno32 is connected to and replace the X with the corresponding number. Just trying numbers 1-9 should work well too. 

macOS
1) Install MCB32tools
2) Open the MCB32Tools terminal. Note it opens minimized, so you have to click the icon again.
3) Navigate to the project folder with "cd" ("IS1200-expo/mp-test" is where you should be)
4) Write "make" in the terminal to compile the code
5) Connect the UNO32 to your mac via USB
6) In a separate Terminal window of your choice (can not be done via MCB32tools CLI) type "ls /dev/" to list connected devices. The Uno32 will show up in the list as "tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX" where the last 8 characters will depend for each machine.
7) Type "make install TTYDEV=/dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXXX" in the terminal (replace the X's with whatever you found in step 6!) to upload the code to the Uno32
